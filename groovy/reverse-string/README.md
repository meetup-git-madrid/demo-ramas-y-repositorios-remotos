## Making the test suite pass

We are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build and test our exercises if you have a local version of Gradle installed you can use it.
If not, we have the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) installed into the exercises. If you wish to use the Gradle Wrapper please make sure `gradlew` is executable on your platform beforehand.

On MacOS/Linux, please run:

```sh
$ chmod +x gradlew
```

Execute the tests with:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
